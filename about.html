            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>PetMatch was created to help animals in shelters find loving homes by making the adoption process easier for potential pet owners. Thousands of animals are in need of homes but struggle to find the right match.</p>
            
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>We connect adopters with shelters and rescue organizations through our platform, providing up-to-date information about available pets and making the search process simple and intuitive.</p>
